# Autonomous Vehicle Model Training Repository
Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle Model Training Repository! This repository contains essential files and tools for training an autonomous vehicle model. Whether you’re a researcher, developer, or just curious about self-driving cars, this collection will help you understand the process and build your own autonomous vehicle.

## Contents:
1.Training Images:
  The “images” folder houses a diverse set of pictures used for training the model. These images represent various road scenarios, including curves, straight stretches, intersections, and more.
  

2.Trained Model (model.h5):
  Inside this file lies a neural network model that has been meticulously trained. The model predicts vehicle control outputs based on camera images captured during driving.
  
3.Behavioral_Cloning.ipynb:

  This Jupyter Notebook serves as the heart of data preprocessing. It covers essential steps such as:
  
-Loading training images.

-Cropping images to focus on relevant features.

-Normalizing pixel values for consistent processing.

-Creating well-structured training and testing datasets.

    
4.drive.py:

  The Python script “drive.py” communicates with the Udemy autonomous vehicle simulator. It receives telemetry data (including camera images, speed, and steering angle) and passes them to the trained model. The model then predicts control commands, which drive.py sends back to the simulator.

## Get Involved:
Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to this repository. Whether you’re fine-tuning the model, enhancing data preprocessing, or adapting it for your specific use case, this repository provides a solid foundation.
